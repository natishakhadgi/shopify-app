# Spacestagram

An app to help share photos from APOD, a NASA’s image API.

This project serves as a Technical Challenge for the Shopify Frontend Intern (Winter 2022) opportunity.

You can view the project [here](https://spacestagram-natisha.herokuapp.com/).

## Technical Requirements

- Search results should come from NASA’s free APIs.
- Free to use any front end framework/component library (or none at all!).
- Each image result should list at least a title, date of capture (ideally in earth_date) and a button to “like” that image.
- Each image can be “liked”, and a user should be able to undo their “like”
- The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic (MDN reference)

### Features

- Loading Spinner for API call.
- Like and Unlike images.
- Shareable link for each image.

### Technologies

- React
- [NASA APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/)
- [Masonry Library](https://masonry.desandro.com/) for grid layout.
- Heroku for hosting.
